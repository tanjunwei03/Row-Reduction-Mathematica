I was too lazy to perform row reduction on a matrix by hand and to type it out in latex (I work exclusively on latex thanks to Gilles Castel's amazing article on typing latex quickly). Hence, I created this mathematica code that not just allows you to perform elementary row operations without actually doing the meaningless work of addition and subtraction and multiplication yourself, but also exports the resulting computation to latex for you.
